The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight , the may also be fattening our children . Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics , they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic . A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese , leading to fears that today 's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents . Obesity : Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers , a large-scale study has found ( file photo ) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription . By two years-old , one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese . And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight . Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler . Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics . They were also slightly taller than boys who had n't been given the drugs . The study did n't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain . But if they do , it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten . This frees up more food for the body . Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite . Lead author Dr Antti Saari , of Kuopio University Hospital , warned : 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age , or repeatedly during infancy , was associated with increased body mass in healthy children . 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy . The worldwide obesity epidemic is real , and is more pronounced for boys . 'Epidemic ' : By two years-old , one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight ( file photo ) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems . 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences . ' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems . The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat . The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak .",

On Tuesday , a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing , citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast .

An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors , nor bodies , nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized , Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said . There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats . Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy According to the International Organization for Migration , Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015 , and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily . Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria , the IOM said . They use Libya as a country of transit . At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year , often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers , the IOM said .

According to Pakistani media , Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan , the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran . The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan , according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn . Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory . One of the deadliest was in October 2013 , when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan . Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks , the militants have fled back into Balochistan . `` Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists , '' IRNA said , referring to Pakistan . The Pakistani government condemned Monday 's attack , calling it an `` act of terrorism . '' `` The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident , which took place on Iran 's territory , and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have , '' the government said in a statement Wednesday .

Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

Kevin Rebbie , 56 , of Limerick Township , faces several charges , including aggravated indecent assault , unlawful contact with a minor , sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy , the Montgomery County District Attorney 's Office said .

She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep . She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13 , Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her , according to Philly.com . Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom , 34 of which showed victims as they showered . Rebbie uploaded the videos , some that included close-up images of children 's genitalia , to his computer to view later , prosecutors said .

Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . A spokesman for the police department said : 'There was some discussion , some rumoring , there may have been a second person involved . 'That information came from within the school , and it turned out to be true . ' Granado , who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , Texas ( pictured ) , was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy , also 15 , and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday , and released after posting a $ 50,000 bail . It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her . A spokesman for Irving school district said : 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details , we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action . 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property . '",

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds , which assess English , maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury , Gloucestershire . This was despite the exam session finishing , a conduct panel heard . Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury , pictured , to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil 's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off . After the suspected breach of exam rules , school officials were tipped off , resulting in an investigation being launched in June . The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same . It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year , the hearing was told . Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct . The Department for Education annulled the whole school 's SAT 's results after a probe by the local education authority ( file picture ) However , he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers , but to make them more legible . But the panel , run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership , said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions . Panel chair Martin Pilkington said , although the teacher \u2019 s conduct had been dishonest , it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty . But he added : 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school , that can in no way excuse his behaviour . 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority . ' Paul Heathcote , acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan , banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years . He said : 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014 . 'Mr Guffick \u2019 s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress . 'In all the circumstances , I agree with the panel \u2019 s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction . 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions . ' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court .",
