They are used in medical imaging to visualize the internal structures of the body, such as bones, organs, and tissues. X-rays work by passing through the body and being absorbed differently by different materials. For example, bone is more dense than soft tissue, so it absorbs more X-rays, making it appear white on an X-ray image. Soft tissues, such as muscle and fat, appear darker because they absorb more X-rays. X-rays are commonly used to diagnose a wide range of medical conditions, including fractures, tumors, and infections.

X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation that can penetrate various materials, including human tissues. They are used in medical imaging to visualize the internal structures of the body, such as bones, organs, and tissues. X-rays work by passing through the body and being absorbed differently by different materials. For example, bone is more dense than soft tissue, so it absorbs more X-rays, resulting in a lighter appearance on the X-ray image. X-rays are commonly used to diagnose conditions such as fractures, tumors, and infections, as well as to monitor the progress of treatment for these conditions. In the case of the X-ray image, it shows the chest and rib cage, which are essential for breathing and maintaining the proper positioning of the heart and lungs.
