Previously seen pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes are better seen/evaluated on CT. No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Continued low lung volumes with substantial mass in the right paratracheal region.
The ET tube is 3.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach.  Right IJ Cordis tip is in the proximal SVC.  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  There is ill-defined vasculature and alveolar infiltrate, right greater than left.  This is markedly increased compared to the film from two hours prior and likely represents fluid overload.
Left PICC tip is seen terminating in the region of the distal left brachiocephalic vein.  Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged standard position.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  Marked calcification of the aortic knob is again present.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is similar.  Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities are minimally improved.  Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen in the left upper quadrant.
Single AP portable view of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are clear of large confluent consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette enlarged but could be accentuated by positioning and relatively low inspiratory effort.  Calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Degenerative changes noted at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally.  Osseous and soft tissue structures otherwise unremarkable.
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is marked improvement in extent and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.  The nasogastric tube has been removed.  Endotracheal tube and the right internal jugular vein introduction sheath are in constant position.
Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional differences.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis has improved, but an area of confluent increased opacity in the right infrahilar region is new.  The latter may reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or developing infection.
A hazy opacity is present in the right lung which may represent aspiration, pleural effusion or hemorrhage.  Retrocardiac opacity at the left base is unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization and enlarged pulmonary arteries are consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Tracheostomy tube is in place.  There are no displaced rib fractures.
Bedside upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates little interval change when compared to prior study performed 24 hours ago.  There is minimal, stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal contours consistent with mild chronic heart failure.  Persistent obscuration of the pulmonary vascular markings in the right lung base is consistent with trace pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis is still present.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  A left internal jugular central venous catheter, an endotracheal tube, and an orogastric tube are unchanged and appropriately positioned.  The chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are once again noted.
Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from ___.  Tracheostomy tube is again noted.  Left PICC tip is not clearly delineated on the current exam.  Again there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis; however infection cannot be excluded.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
There are no old films available for comparison.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is a right IJ Cordis with tip in the upper SVC.  There is mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution, but no definite infiltrates or effusion.
In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube again courses beyond the lower margin of the image in the distal stomach.  The left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen and there is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and areas of plate-like atelectasis.  Continued mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Comparison is made to previous study from ___.  There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 6.2 cm above the carina appropriately sited.  There is a left-sided IJ line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC.  There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and sideport are below the GE junction.  There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity.  There is some atelectasis at the left lung base.  There is improved aeration at the right lung base.  No pneumothoraces are seen.

Constant cardiomegaly with relatively extensive retrocardiac atelectasis and the potential presence of a small left pleural effusion. Mild pulmonary edema.  Areas of atelectasis at the right lung base.  No newly occurred parenchymal opacities.  No pneumothorax.
In comparison with study of ___, the PICC extends only to the left brachiocephalic vein before its junction with the superior vena cava.  Continued low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  Bibasilar opacification most likely reflects atelectatic changes.  Possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  The pulmonary vascular congestion is less prominent than on the prior study.
Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with the patient in the semi-erect position.  Tracheostomy noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged; bulging of the pulmonary outflow tract reflects enlargement of pulmonary arteries and suggests underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Pulmonary edema has slightly improved compared to the prior study.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Again bibasilar opacifications are noted and are suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are constant in position.  The pre-existing right basal opacity, with maximum in the infrahilar area, is not substantially changed.  On the left, there is decreased visibility of the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting the appearance of either atelectasis or small left pleural effusion.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  The right costophrenic sinus is unremarkable.

There is prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  There is some atelectasis at the left lung base.
Single AP portable chest radiograph is obtained.  Tracheostomy tube is present.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is a hazy veil-like opacity in the right upper lung zone which may be consolidation, atelectasis or artifact.  Heart size appears enlarged; however, this may be technical due to AP view.  Bony structures are intact.
The lungs are clear bilaterally with no areas of focal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patient is status post CABG.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Mediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.

The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Sternal wires are intact.
The previously seen right lower lobe opacification has decreased substantially.  There has also been a mild decrease in the amount of vascular engorgement suggesting improvement in mild biventricular heart failure.  In retrospect, given the rapid change, the opacification likely represented fluid overload.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The sternal wires are intact and midline.  There is longstanding midline lucency in the manubrium and upper body is due to incomplete sternal fusion; there is no evidence of other incision complications. A PICC can be traced to the mid SVC.

A left Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium, unchanged from prior.  Lung volumes are extremely low resulting in bronchovascular crowding and limited evaluation of the lung bases.  Diffuse interstitial opacities have increased, and despite the low lung volumes, findings are consistent with superimposed pulmonary edema on a background of pulmonary fibrosis. No large pleural effusion is evident.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  High density material within multiple mid thoracic vertebral bodies is likely related to prior kyphoplasty, unchanged from prior.
In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change.  Substantial cardiomegaly with bilateral opacifications most likely reflecting pulmonary edema.
