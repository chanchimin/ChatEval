    "AP and lateral views of the chest.   Thereis hyperinflation, consistent with background COPD.  There is increased diffuse parenchymal opacities bilaterally, more prominent at the bases consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions layering posteriorly, left greater than right.  There is fluid in the major fissure seen on the lateral view.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated laterally."

    "Single portable view of the chest.  Bibasilar opacities with blunting of the costophrenic angles which could be due to effusions.  There are indistinct pulmonary vascular markings.  Relatively lentiform-shaped opacity over the right mid lung is suggestive of fluid within the fissure.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted."

Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema is again demonstrated.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident."

Previously seen left lower lobe opacity has resolved on the frontal view but may persist on lateral view obscuring the posterior costophrenic angle, which could represent a component of residual infection and/or atelectasis.  There is trace basilar atelectasis on the right.  There is no large effusion.  Eventration is seen on the right, unchanged."
