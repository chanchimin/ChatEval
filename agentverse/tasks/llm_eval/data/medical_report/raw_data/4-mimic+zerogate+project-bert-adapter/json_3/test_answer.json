The heart size is at the upper limit of\n normal variation.  The heart configuration suggests a relative prominence of\n the left ventricular contour, a finding which in conjunction with the\n moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta suggests the possibility of\n systemic hypertension.  There is no acute pulmonary congestion.  In the right\n hemithorax pleural thickenings are identified and seen to clear along the\n lateral chest wall.  This coincides with the previously described local\n resection of the posterior aspect of the fourth rib related to previously\n performed tracheal reconstruction.  These post-operative changes have not\n undergone any significant interval change.  No pneumothorax is present.  On\n the lateral view the posterior pleural sinuses are free from any free fluid,\n pleural effusion.",

Analysis performed in direct comparison with the next\n preceding portable chest examination of ___, i.e. 11 hours earlier during\n the same day.  The patient has now been intubated and ETT seen in the trachea\n to terminate some 4 cm above the level of the carina.  No pneumothorax has\n developed.  Identified is also an intra-aortic balloon pump device in the\n aorta with the metallic tip reaching just to the lower contour of the aortic\n arch.  Thus, the position is appropriate.  No pneumothorax has developed in\n comparison with the previous study.  Remarkable finding is a diffuse haze over\n the right hemithorax, more marked than on the left side.  This may be\n explained by a shift of the interstitial edema pattern seen already on\n previous examination as faintly detectable interstitial edema.  An explanation\n could be that the patient during the latest examination interval was mostly\n located on the right side explaining gravitational forces.  There is no\n evidence of overall deterioration of the pulmonary congestion nor is there\n evidence of any new parenchymal infiltrate.
