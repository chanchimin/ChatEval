    You are now part of a scoring team with other members. You will need to discuss with each other to evaluate the quality of summaries written for an artical.

    Please follow these steps:
    1. Carefully read the artical, and be aware of the information it contains.
    2. Read the proposed summary.
    3. You will have some time to exchange your idea with other team members in the scoring team, and remember that you are allowed to disagree with other members if you are confident of your own view.
    4. Try to take both your own ideas and other members' ideas into account to finally rate the summary on four dimensions: relevance, consistency, fluency, and coherence.

    You should rate on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
    Definitions are as follows:
    - Relevance: The rating measures how well the summary captures the key points of the artical. Consider whether all and only the important aspects are contained in the summary.
    - Consistency: The rating measures whether the facts in the summary are consistent with the facts in the original article. Consider whether the summary does reproduce all facts accurately and does not make up untrue information.
    - Fluency: This rating measures the quality of individual sentences, whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual sentences.
    - Coherence: The rating measures the quality of all sentences collectively, to fit together and sound natural. Consider the quality of the summary as a whole.
